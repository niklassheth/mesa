# Apple9 compute through the m1n1 DRM shim

This development tree runs Mesa's Asahi Gallium driver against a real T8132
through the modern Asahi DRM UAPI. The preload library presents a render node,
embeds the m1n1 Python backend, and forwards device parameters, VM/GEM
operations, queues, synchronization, and submissions to the source-built G16
firmware backend.

The current Mesa milestone is **compute**. The earlier capture-matched Apple9
render compiler was removed because it was no longer representative of the
compiler and packaging model. Render packaging helpers and the GLES triangle
fixture remain useful research scaffolding, but a render shader currently
fails during compilation and the triangle is not a regression gate.

## Current compute model

- T8132 is exposed as G16G and T8140 as G17P. Apple9 has a distinct shader-ISA
  key and is not silently compiled as Apple8.
- G16 and G17 use the same fixed 1-TiB USC base, `0x10000000000`. The former
  relocatable G17 behavior was a shim mistake, not a hardware capability.
- GLSL compute shaders travel through Gallium and NIR into a semantic Apple9
  VIR, register allocator, scheduler, and machine encoder. Accepted shaders do
  not select a captured whole-main byte sequence.
- Scoreboard slots are allocated as compiler state. Pending asynchronous
  producers carry a slot; compatible consumers name that slot and release or
  retain it according to liveness. Ordinary ALU results are ordinary GPR
  values, not a second provenance system.
- The allocator supports the measured r0-r63 bank, scalar and adjacent tuple
  classes, copies around constrained instructions, and last-use release.
  Independent vector lanes are joined by a pre-allocation `COLLECT` pseudo,
  coalesced when already adjacent, and otherwise copied after allocation;
  vector stores never borrow an untracked scratch tuple after allocation.
  Spilling is not implemented and excess pressure fails compilation.
- Gallium owns the compute archive, compiler state, resource records, carrier
  installation, CDM command, BOs, VM bindings, and ordinary
  `drm_asahi_cmd_compute` submission.
- One eight-buffer superset carrier serves ordinary compute, while a second
  own-source eight-buffer carrier supplies the independently validated device-
  atomic launch contract. A compiled main may use any prefix of one through
  eight resources in either ABI; resource count does not select a launcher.
- The shared fixed-USC archive is append-only between installations. A
  screen-wide timeline serializes physical ownership changes, while each
  logical DRM VM keeps its own persistent root in the m1n1 backend.

The supported NIR surface is intentionally limited. It includes arbitrary
u32 constants; integer add/subtract, negate, multiply, AND/OR/XOR/NOT, shifts,
signed and unsigned min/max; core float arithmetic, FP32 reciprocal, reciprocal
square root, exp2, log2, floor, ceil, truncation, round-to-even, sqrt, sin, cos,
and FMA; comparisons, straight-line select, recursively nested structured
if/else, and general structured loops with loop-carried values, `break`,
`continue`, and nesting within the six encoded predicate scratch banks;
scalar/vector device loads and stores;
general constant, affine, and runtime buffer indexing; 8/16/32-bit memory
formats; and the measured system values and dense dispatch geometries used by
the fixtures. Scalar 32-bit SSBO atomics include integer add/subtract,
AND/OR/XOR, signed and unsigned min/max, exchange, compare-exchange, and the
NIR floating-add operation. Returned and discarded forms, dynamic addresses,
contention, and masked or looped atomics all use semantic VIR and allocated
registers. A final-use scalar device-load result may feed a returning atomic
directly through its allocated scoreboard slot. Live-after values, pending
indices, compare-exchange tuples, and discarded atomics remain on the
materialized path until their destructive-input contracts are proven.

The control-flow emitter recursively walks structured NIR and serializes its
implicit execution-mask stack. Every pending asynchronous load or atomic
return is copied to a durable GPR before its NIR block ends, so no pending
result crosses a nested push, else transition, or reconvergence pop. The load sequence's native
`HAS_NEXT` bit still follows linear issue order across those transitions, while
the formerly named `FIRST` bit is now modeled correctly as the raw `get_sr`
index address form. Arm-local stores use the native compare, execution-mask
push, else-transition, and pop sequence. Scalar and 1--4 component Boolean or
8/16/32-bit phis use the same compiler architecture as Apple8: register
allocation assigns one merge destination per component, and each predecessor
performs an ordinary bit-copy into that destination while its lane mask is
active. Merge destinations remain disjoint from every edge source, making each
edge's copy set parallel-copy safe without post-allocation scratch registers.
The merge pseudo itself emits no hardware instruction.
Native select formation remains a future optimization; keeping it disabled for
CFG phis makes this correctness-first slice exercise masked arm computation and
reconvergence directly.

Loops follow the public Apple8 compiler's structured architecture while using
Apple9's independently measured encodings. The emitter recursively walks the
complete NIR loop body; it does not recognize, clone, or rebuild a special
header/latch condition. Each structured break updates or unwinds the current
loop mask wherever it occurs, and one `JMP_EXEC_ANY` repeats the surviving
lanes. Semantic VIR operations represent loop-mask push/update/pop,
empty/active-lane branches, and nonlocal break unwinding. Branches name VIR
boundaries and are resolved to signed, start-relative byte displacements only
after all variable-sized pseudos have been emitted. Header and exit phis use
the same predecessor-edge merge architecture as `if` joins, and allocator
liveness is extended across every backedge. Source `continue` constructs are
lowered to structured masked latch paths; a `break` beneath nested divergent
scopes uses the native unwind record tied to its target loop's predicate level.
The exact hardware corpus covers zero-trip and bottom-tested loops, a break in
the middle of otherwise conditional loop work, compound conditions, general
and nested break, continue, three nested loop levels, vector recurrences, and
per-iteration device loads.

This early bring-up path deliberately does not implement robust buffer access.
The compiler does not infer resource access bounds, and dispatch does not
preflight a shader-derived byte span. Buffer indices are passed through to the
generated address calculation; callers are responsible for binding enough
storage for every access the shader can make.

Early return, general division/modulo, spilling, and unmeasured
package/resource forms reject rather than falling back to capture-assigned
registers or opaque native mains.

### FP32 math

The special functions use semantic VIR operations, allocated registers, and
the ordinary pending-producer dependency mask. Both pending and materialized
sources support retained and final uses. The SFU source-control byte (byte 6)
uses `0x90` for retain and `0xb0` for final use. Reciprocal has a distinct form
using `0x00` and `0x10`. Applying reciprocal's bit-4 rule to the ordinary SFU
selects `0xa0`, which reads a **bfloat16** source from the low 16 bits instead
of FP32. Those bits were zero in many early inputs. EXP-M4-54 confirms this
with matched native BF16/FP16/FP32 Metal shaders and packed-input mutations.
Ordinary-SFU source type occupies byte 6 bits [4:3], while reciprocal places
it in byte 7 bits [3:2]. The lifetime difference is part of distinct operand
layouts, independent of the scoreboard; no blanket source-copy workaround is
used. Ordinary-SFU source negation is byte 8 bit 0 and absolute value is byte 7
bit 7. Earlier positive-only rsqrt/log2 probes mistook negation for a NaN control.

`sqrt` uses the `0x2f` class-1 sqrt factor followed by a multiply. EXP-M4-55
establishes that this factor returns 1 for signed zero and positive infinity,
and the usual rsqrt factor for positive normal inputs. Multiplication by the
input supplies fast sqrt with signed-zero and infinity handling built in.
The tested arithmetic mode treats denormal SFU inputs and outputs as signed
zero. NaN results are checked by classification; payload propagation is not
promised. The source stays live across the factor until the multiply, using
the allocator's ordinary liveness handling.

`sin` and `cos` use the `0x2f` class-3 factor, represented by the FP32 NIR
operation `fsin_factor_agx`: `sin(pi*x/2)/x` on [-1,1], with the pi/2 limit at
zero and NaN outside that interval. An independently constructed 256-bit
fixed-point expansion of 2/pi preserves quadrant information across the
finite FP32 range. The two-part reduced phase feeds factor-and-multiply
operations for sine and its complement for cosine. FMA corrections preserve
the phase residual and account for complement subtraction rounding. No Taylor
polynomial remains. This opcode evaluates reduced angles; it does not perform
range reduction or quadrant selection.

Tiny sine inputs and signed zero are preserved by bit selection; infinities
and NaNs return NaN. Full-range reduction still has substantial code and
register cost. Large combined expressions can exceed the current allocator's
no-spill register budget.

## External development inputs

The repository deliberately does not contain captured Metal package blobs.
During this bring-up phase, five recapturable inputs from two own-source
eight-buffer carriers are loaded from hardcoded paths under
`/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9`:

```text
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/carrier8/constant.bin
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/carrier8/launch.bin
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/carrier8/division.bin
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/carrier8-atomic/constant.bin
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/carrier8-atomic/launch.bin
```

The carrier resource record has three hidden entries followed by eight visible
buffer entries and a zero sentinel. For direct dispatch, q0 points to the
record's total-thread tuple and q1 to `{1,1,1}`. For indirect dispatch, q0 is
the caller's raw group-count pointer and q1 points to the record's local-size
scale tuple. The unchanged launch program derives the common execution
geometry from that tagged representation. The third hidden entry points to the
relocated 8-KiB integer-division helper table in `division.bin`.
Unused visible entries are padded with a valid mapped pointer that the compiled
main cannot reference. The full one-through-eight prefix has passed exact
hardware output and input/guard-preservation checks through ordinary GLSL,
Gallium, the DRM UAPI, and the G16 shim.

The atomic carrier was captured from the own-source eight-buffer workload in
`EXP-M4-48-atomic-package`. It publishes the eight caller buffers directly at
q0--q7, with no hidden geometry or division-table resources. Mesa replaces its
own-source stage main with the compiled main and patches the launch/archive and
resource pointers semantically. Direct dispatch, fixed or runtime local size,
and all ordinary compute system registers are supported. This capture does not
establish an indirect-dispatch launcher or a `gl_NumWorkGroups` hidden-resource
contract; those combinations reject instead of reading caller buffers as
metadata. The two carrier families are loaded independently, so missing atomic
development inputs do not disable ordinary compute and vice versa.

File lengths are taken from the files. The driver validates only the regions
it actually installs or patches; it does not require an exact whole-file size.

Two optional, currently non-gated render research inputs use the same
directory:

```text
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/g16_render_package.bin.zst
/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/tmp/agx-apple9/render_interleaved_vbo_launch.bin
```

They do not restore the removed render compiler. They are retained outside Git
only so future packaging work can reuse the current semantic relocation and
archive experiments without putting opaque Metal data in repository history.

The current local T8132 input hashes are:

```

The compute files are development inputs, not stable ABI. Recapture notes
should record their source workload, OS/build, package role, and hash outside
the Mesa repository until their remaining fields are replaced by semantic
builders.

## Build

The Asahi driver needs Mesa's generated internal CLC programs. On Arch-based
hosts the additional package is `spirv-llvm-translator`.

```sh
meson setup /home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/mesa-m1n1-build \
  --prefix /home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/mesa-m1n1-install/usr/local \
  -Dgallium-drivers=asahi \
  -Degl=enabled \
  -Dplatforms=[] \
  -Degl-native-platform=surfaceless \
  -Dgles1=disabled \
  -Dgles2=enabled \
  -Dglx=disabled \
  -Dgbm=disabled \
  -Dvulkan-drivers=[] \
  -Dllvm=enabled \
  -Dbuild-tests=true \
  -Dtools=drm-shim

ninja -C /home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/mesa-m1n1-build
```

Useful host-only gates are:

```sh
meson test -C /home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/mesa-m1n1-build \
  agx_tests \
  --print-errorlogs

/home/nsheth/Projects/asahi/mesa-m1n1-build/src/asahi/drm-shim/\
t8132_apple9_compute_runner --list
```

## Run on T8132

Build and chainload the matching `m1n1-m4-agx` tree first, leaving the target
at its proxy prompt with a cold GPU ASC. The native compute tests enter through
ordinary GLES 3.1, the normal Mesa driver, and the DRM UAPI; they do not
construct NIR or m1n1 work records directly.

Run the default supported compute regression set directly in one process and
EGL context:

```sh
src/asahi/drm-shim/piglit/run.sh direct
```

The default one-boot sequence omits `archive-cross-program-sequence`,
`program-lifecycle-stress`, the math matrix, and the 24-program
`two-source-comparisons` matrix
to reduce pressure on the temporary append-only 64 KiB shader archive. As the
ordinary compiler corpus grows, a complete default run can still reach that
temporary limit; run the named control-flow and lifecycle batches separately
after fresh chainloads when it does. Archive exhaustion is a packaging-harness
limit, not a shader result. The two lifecycle cases test program-publication
lifetime; the comparison matrix is the exhaustive predicate correctness gate.

Or record each named case as a Piglit subtest while retaining the same
single-process execution model:

```sh
src/asahi/drm-shim/piglit/run.sh piglit
```

Success means exact complete-buffer comparison, not merely command retirement.
The native cases also verify immutable inputs, poison-filled gaps, leading and
trailing guards, multiple bindings and dependent addresses. Dedicated cases
exercise repeated range dispatch, program publication/retirement pressure, and
ordered reuse of independently compiled programs.
`simple-divergent-if-else` checks unsigned, signed, and floating-point `<`,
`>=`, equality, inequality, and composed Boolean forms with mixed, all-true,
and all-false lane populations. Its floating-point inputs include NaNs and both
signed zeros, so `>=` is validated as an IEEE ordered comparison rather than a
naive inversion of `<`. Each of its 36 submissions verifies both predicated arm
stores and a post-reconvergence value merge across complete 16,384-word outputs,
while inactive outputs retain poison and surrounding guards remain unchanged.
`two-source-comparisons` independently computes both operands and covers every
canonical signed, unsigned, and floating-point equality/order relation,
including relations normalized by reversing operands. It runs mixed, all-true,
and all-false populations; the mixed floating-point population includes NaNs,
infinities, adjacent finite values, and both signed zeros. Additional short and
extended predicates keep neither, either, or both sources live after the
comparison. `compare-register-pressure` repeats a retained-source comparison
with 16 independently loaded values live across the region.
`single-region-shapes` covers empty, then-only, else-only, and two-sided arms,
with exact stores before, inside, and after the region. `multiple-phi-vectors`
checks a scalar phi and a four-component phi from ordinary GLSL through exact
scalar and vector-buffer outputs.
`branch-local-device-loads` uses seven SSBOs and three executions to cover
mixed, all-true, and all-false lane populations. It performs distinct affine
loads in both arms, fans each loaded value into an arm-local side effect and a
32-bit phi, then combines the merged value with a post-reconvergence load. All
three complete 16,384-word output buffers, inactive poison values, and guard
regions are checked exactly.
`nested-short-circuit-if-else` covers nested conditionals in both outer arms,
multi-level value reconvergence, sibling and asymmetric regions, and observable
right-hand-side stores for short-circuit AND and OR. Seven complete 16,384-word
outputs verify both final values and that skipped right-hand sides leave poison
unchanged. `nested-branch-local-loads` issues two distinct pending loads in
each of four nested leaf regions, resolves their values through both inner and
outer phis, and checks two complete guarded outputs. The two tests also pass
back-to-back in one process and persistent VM.
`reciprocal-direct`, `reciprocal-retain`, and `reciprocal-materialized` cover
pending-load handoff, source lifetime, and ordinary-GPR input paths with exact
FP32 output oracles. `reciprocal-denominators-1-1024` converts every integer
denominator in the permitted local-size domain with the compiler's ordinary
U2F and reciprocal path, then checks the returned FP32 values against
`abs(D * r - 1) <= 2^-18`. On T8132 the worst observed denominator is 981,
with residual `7.1362592279911041e-8`; no Newton refinement is required for
the ceiling-division lowering. `ceil-div-grid-domain` executes the compiler's
complete U2F/reciprocal/FMA/F2U/multiply/compare/correct sequence for eight
numerators at every denominator, including zero, remainder boundaries, and
the maximum legal `65535 * D`; all 8,192 exact integer outputs pass on T8132.

The separately runnable math cases are `sfu-rsqrt`, `sfu-sqrt`, `sfu-exp2`,
`sfu-log2`, `sfu-floor`, `sfu-ceil`, `sfu-trunc`, and `sfu-round-even`, plus a
`-materialized` variant of each. Every case checks 4,096 inputs: a retained
source, its result, a separate final-use pending input, and an ALU consumer
of the result, totaling 16,384 values plus immutable inputs and buffer guards.
Rounding functions require exact results; rsqrt/sqrt/exp2/log2 allow two ULPs
against host double-precision libm rounded to FP32. The ALU consumer is checked
against the independently validated rounded SFU result. Directed cases cover
signed zero, infinities, NaNs, denormals, exponent extremes, and rounding ties;
the remaining inputs are deterministic randomized values.

Run `math-sin`, `math-cos`, `math-sin-boundaries`, `math-cos-boundaries`,
`math-sin-reduced`, and `math-cos-reduced` as another batch after a fresh
chainload. They use the same buffer checks and
two-ULP numerical tolerance. Boundary cases sample neighboring FP32 values at
small multiples of pi/2 and at powers of two times pi/2 through exponent 127,
with both signs. Reduced cases densely sample [-pi,pi], exercising both factor
arguments and the small-input path. This is sampled numerical validation, not an exhaustive
two-ULP guarantee over all FP32 bit patterns. `--list` includes all math cases;
`--list-default` excludes them to keep archive-heavy batches separate.

`superset-1` through `superset-8` specifically compile distinct ordinary GLSL
programs and exercise every active-resource occupancy of the shared carrier.
`device-atomic-native-shape` reproduces the own-source eight-resource Metal
workload through the normal GLSL compiler and checks every target and four-word
result record. `device-atomics` checks discarded and returned forms, every
GLES-visible integer operation, compare-exchange success and failure, signed
and unsigned min/max, multiple retained results, two writable resources,
256-lane contention with a return-value permutation oracle, divergent loops
with discarded and returned atomics, 4,096 exact private-address recurrences,
and 32 consecutive 1,024-lane dispatches into the same counters. Every result
and final target is compared, rather than using command retirement as success.
`device-atomic-pending-load-forwarding` combines a directly forwarded final-use
load, a live-after load that must be materialized selectively, and an unrelated
pending load whose lifetime must not be drained by the atomic.

The indirect-dispatch geometry cases exercise the actual GLES API with CPU-
and GPU-authored records, nonzero offsets, zero dimensions, and asymmetric 2D
and 3D grids. `gl_NumWorkGroups` is compiled from the hidden q0/q1 package
contract and checked in every dimension for direct and indirect execution. It
does not consume a visible buffer binding or require CPU inspection of the
indirect record. Direct dispatch computes `ceil(global_threads / local_size)`
with the measured FP32 reciprocal sequence and one exact integer correction;
this covers short final workgroups and fixed or runtime local sizes. Indirect
dispatch returns the caller-provided group count directly.

## Bring-up boundary

This branch is an investigative compiler and packaging harness, not a complete
Mesa driver. The immediate productive direction is to keep expanding semantic
compute lowering and replace each external wrapper field as it becomes
understood. Render should resume from compiler-generated stage code and a
verified packaging model; the old capture-matched render compiler should not
be resurrected as a fallback.
