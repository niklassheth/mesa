 * The compositional profile accepts one scalar 32-bit store to buffer(0),
 * indexed by global_invocation_id.x.  A second, separately captured profile
 * accepts two scalar float loads from buffers 0/1, one fadd, and a scalar
 * float store to buffer 2 at that same index.  The compiler selects exact
 * Apple9 instructions for both profiles and rejects every other memory/control
 * graph; it never falls back to a plausible but unproved package. Control
 * flow, spilling, vectors, and general memory operations remain later
 * milestones.

 * On failure, *reason points at a static diagnostic string when reason is

 * Compile straight-line FP32 graphics NIR through the common semantic VIR and
 * register allocator. Fragment inputs support pixel-center smooth FP32 user
 * components; RT0 is a complete vec4 packed to RGBA8. Vertex inputs use vertex
 * ID and FP32 vertex elements; exports cover position plus up to twelve user
 * scalars across VAR0..VAR31, compacted by semantic location and component.
 * Fragment variants use the producer's layout, including unused outputs.
 * User UVS values stay unprojected for clipping and require perspective CF
 * bindings. The FS uses coefficient-aware projective multiplication, which
 * handles both ordinary and primitive-constant coefficient representations.
 * Constant array offsets and component holes are supported. Up to four buffer
 * arguments per stage use common buffer lowering.
 * Vertex elements and UBOs share that budget. The resource-binding array
 * records hardware argument order; apple9_ubo_mask records API UBO bindings.
 * SSBOs, other interpolation modes, MRT, and structured graphics control flow fail
 * closed. The caller supplies hardware clip coordinates and compatible stage
 * and render-target state.
